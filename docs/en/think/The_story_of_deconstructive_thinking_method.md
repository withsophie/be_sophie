# The Story of Deconstructive Thinking
> Alex Sudo @ Jul 2024

This story comes from Wan Weigang, a columnist and scientist I greatly admire. His article inspired me to write about deconstructive thinking. To honor the original author, I'm presenting the main ideas here to help everyone better understand "deconstructive thinking."

Let's talk about a powerful mental tool that can protect you from being bullied. For example, if someone claims their work is superior to yours, or says you need certain qualifications, or calls you an outsider who needs to conform - they're trying to bully you. You can immediately counter with this mental weapon.

This weapon isn't a scientific concept, but a philosophical one called "Deconstruction." It was invented by French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004). Derrida's tool is incredibly useful, even more practical than "Occam's Razor." You may have heard the term "deconstruction," but it's still underused.

Simply put, deconstruction means breaking down binary oppositions.

There are always people promoting various binary oppositions - good vs. evil, true vs. false, high culture vs. popular culture, mainstream vs. fringe, etc. - claiming one is superior to the other. Philosophers would say one belongs to the center, the other to the margin. Western philosophy once considered Western culture the center of world civilization, with cultures like China's on the fringe. Deconstruction aims to break down this notion.

Derrida believed these binary oppositions are human constructs, not reality. There's no essential difference between the two sides.

For example, if someone claims reading serious literature is superior to reading popular fiction, you can immediately point out there's no fundamental difference between them. This shows your broader perspective.

How do we deconstruct? We can break it down into three steps:

1. "You in me, me in you": Analyze the components of the two supposedly opposing things. You'll find their main elements are actually quite similar, perhaps differing in proportion but not in essence.

2. "You need me, I need you": Point out how these two things depend on each other.

3. "You become me, I become you": Show how these two things can transform into each other.

After going through these arguments, the idea of superiority often loses its meaning.

Derrida introduced a concept called "différance," combining "difference" and "deferral." It means the meaning of things changes over time.

Deconstruction isn't about saying everything is the same - it's about rejecting a black-and-white worldview. It helps us see the complexity and diversity of things, potentially leading to more creativity and better constructive thinking.

Deconstruction gives you an open and inclusive attitude. It opposes rigid, binary thinking and helps you make wiser judgments.

The world cycles between "construction → deconstruction → reconstruction." We need order, but insightful people know that order is human-made, not destined. All meanings change over time: maybe next time, you'll be the one to deconstruct and reconstruct that order.

Chinese culture has long had concepts like "yin within yang, yang within yin" and "form is not different from emptiness, emptiness is not different from form." Wise people have always been free from the constraints of worldly structures. You might just be unfamiliar with Derrida's specific term "deconstruction" and haven't practiced the three steps of deconstruction we discussed.

But naming is important. With a name, you can more easily recognize patterns in life and actively deconstruct.

In fields like art, media, and design, deconstructive thinking has evolved into "deconstructivism" - deconstructing for the sake of deconstruction, regardless of practicality.

For example, traditional social structure had men doing intense work outside the home while women did housework. Some artistic works deliberately portray families where women go out to work and men stay at home - this is a form of deconstruction. In architecture, traditional buildings aim for grandeur and symmetry, while deconstructivist architecture introduces asymmetrical and non-linear elements, emphasizing complexity, change, and instability. Deconstructivism is at the core of "postmodern" trends. Even deliberate deconstruction can be beneficial as it may drive social progress.

You might ask if the mental cost of deconstruction is too high. Shouldn't we respect the world's order? True, we don't need to deconstruct everything, and not everyone has the capacity for complex thinking. The world needs stable order, and in most cases, going with the flow is fine.

Deconstructivism only opposes rigid order. We don't need to rethink everything, just deconstruct when necessary and when the timing is right.

The world cycles between "construction → deconstruction → reconstruction." We need order, but insightful people know that order is human-made, not destined. All meanings change over time: maybe next time, you'll be the one to deconstruct and reconstruct that order.
