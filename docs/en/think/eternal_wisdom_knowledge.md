# The Eternal Wisdom

Although GPT has not yet reached the level of AGI, perhaps human AGI is not as mysterious as it seems. What AI truly lacks is subjectivity, meaning there are no so-called subjective factors and the coherence of knowledge. In reality, each of us is a wisdom entity constrained by subjective and limited knowledge. I have never worried about what the proliferation of AI might bring to humanity. The first reason is that the trend is unstoppable. The second is that humanity has always been able to find a way out only through change. Throughout thousands of years of history, all human organizations that attempted to rely on fixed certainties and rejected new things have disappeared. Because outside the tribe there are other tribes, outside the religion there are other beliefs, outside the country there is the world, outside the land there is the ocean, and outside the Earth there is the universe. Any human force can only control certainty within its own system, but outside of any system there is a larger system. Therefore, believing in evolutionary systems will always keep the internal system dynamic, although there is also a significant probability of failure. It is this dynamism that makes the system inherently open, achieving rapid entropy reduction through energy and material exchanges with external systems, thereby keeping the system perpetually young. Once a system becomes stagnant, it is destined to become nourishment for external systems and will eventually be consumed. This cannot be attributed to the cruelty of others; it is the fundamental principle of entropy in the universe.

I once wrote a short essay called "The New Columbus Plan." The universe we live in is far more complex than we limited humans can understand. It may even be that this universe does not possess the simple and perfect cosmic code described in classical theoretical systems. Complex systems and evolution might be the essence and path of the universe.

Finally, I quote the epitaph inscribed on the stele of cosmic truth:

> In the boundless space-time, extreme complexity, hidden dimensions, and the melody of the singer, any species is insignificant in their presence. All who reach this star should know that the truth of the universe lies in the journey to this star.
> And that isâ€”
> Only evolution can combat the infinite.
