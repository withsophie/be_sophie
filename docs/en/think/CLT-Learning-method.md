# The Story of CLT Learning method
> Alex Sudo @ Aug 2024

**Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)** was proposed by psychologist John Sweller in the 1980 s. This theory mainly examines the process of information processing during learning, particularly how to optimize information presentation in instructional design to enhance learning efficiency.

### Three Types of Cognitive Load

1. **Intrinsic Cognitive Load**:
   - This is determined by the complexity and difficulty of the learning material itself. For example, the cognitive load for learning simple addition is different from that for learning calculus. This load is unavoidable but can be managed through gradual guidance and phased learning.

2. **Extraneous Cognitive Load**:
   - This is caused by the way the learning material is presented or by environmental factors. For instance, disorganized explanations, irrelevant information, or complex charts can increase extraneous load. This load can be reduced through good instructional design.

3. **Germane Cognitive Load**:
   - This load is related to learning and understanding, and it is beneficial. It reflects the effort the learner puts into understanding the material and forming new knowledge structures. This load should be encouraged as it promotes deep learning.

Reducing cognitive load is an effective strategy for learning new knowledge. I conducted an experiment with AI on a piece of content as follows:

**Tensorplex offers a range of products focused on decentralized AI, built on networks like Bittensor. As an active participant in the Bittensor ecosystem, they provide services including Tensorplex Stream, which offers AI-generated summaries for podcasts, Twitter spaces, and news articles. They are also actively engaged in mining on the Bittensor subnet. One of their products, Tensorplex Stake, was launched on Ethereum in February 2024, allowing users to participate in staking on the Bittensor network and earn returns (currently over 16%). Here’s how it works:**
   
- **Tensorplex Stake** allows users to stake their wTAO and receive stTAO in return. StTAO represents the staked TAO and tracks staking rewards.
  
- The underlying wTAO is bridged to the Bittensor network and staked with validators to earn rewards. These rewards are returned to users on Ethereum. This approach provides a convenient way for Ethereum users to explore TAO’s earning opportunities without bridging assets to Bittensor.

This content introduces a blockchain protocol that is difficult to understand for someone unfamiliar with blockchain. According to Cognitive Load Theory, it is filled with significant intrinsic or extraneous cognitive load. I asked GPT to identify the cognitive load within this content:

## Intrinsic Cognitive Load
In this content, several aspects cause intrinsic cognitive load, mainly due to the complexity of concepts and the need for specialized knowledge. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### 1. **Decentralized AI and Bittensor Network**
   - **Complexity**: The concept of "decentralized AI" is complex for readers unfamiliar with blockchain or decentralized technology. The Bittensor network is also a specialized term that requires background knowledge to understand.
   - **Source of Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: Understanding the basic principles of decentralized AI and the functions and roles of the Bittensor network.

### 2. **Product Line and Services**
   - **Complexity**: Mentioned products and services like "Tensorplex Stream" and "Tensorplex Stake" are specialized technical products. Understanding the functions and roles behind these terms requires knowledge of the relevant field.
   - **Source of Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: Readers need to understand the specific use cases, technical background, and operational processes of these products.

### 3. **Staking and Yield Mechanism**
   - **Complexity**: The concept of staking, along with wTAO and stTAO, is quite complex for readers unfamiliar with blockchain or cryptocurrency. Understanding these terms and their roles in the Bittensor and Ethereum networks requires in-depth technical knowledge.
   - **Source of Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: Understanding the staking mechanism, the meaning of wTAO and stTAO, the bridging process, and how yields are generated.

### 4. **Cross-Chain Operations (Bridging)**
   - **Complexity**: Terms like "bridging to the Bittensor network" and "bridging assets to Bittensor" involve cross-chain operations in blockchain technology. These concepts can cause high cognitive load for readers without a technical background.
   - **Source of Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: Understanding the concept of cross-chain bridging, its application in blockchain, and the technical details involved.

### 5. **Yield Calculation and Tracking**
   - **Complexity**: The mention of "stTAO representing staked TAO and tracking staking rewards" involves concepts of yield calculation and tracking, which require an understanding of smart contracts and yield distribution mechanisms on the blockchain.
   - **Source of Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: Understanding how stTAO tracks staking rewards and the method of yield calculation and distribution.

## Extraneous Cognitive Load
Analyzing the extraneous cognitive load in this content, several aspects may increase the difficulty of learning:
### 1. **Sources of Extraneous Cognitive Load**:
1. **Frequent Use of Terms**: The content is filled with specialized terms (e.g., "decentralized AI," "Bittensor network," "staking," "wTAO," "stTAO") without explanations, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with these fields.
2. **High Information Density**: The paragraph includes multiple concepts and function explanations without separating them for detailed explanation, potentially burdening the reader during understanding.
3. **Complex Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are complex with extensive information, increasing the cognitive burden on the reader.
4. **Lack of Background Information**: For some readers, the absence of a basic introduction to the Bittensor and Ethereum networks might cause difficulty in understanding.
   
### 2. **Rewriting to Reduce Extraneous Cognitive Load**:
Here’s a simplified version aimed at reducing extraneous cognitive load and making the information easier to understand:

---

**Tensorplex is a company dedicated to decentralized AI solutions, using networks like Bittensor to provide services. They offer a range of products, including Tensorplex Stream and Tensorplex Stake.**

- **Tensorplex Stream** is a service focused on content generation, capable of providing AI-generated summaries for podcasts, Twitter Spaces, and news articles.

- **Tensorplex Stake** is another product that allows users to earn rewards by staking TAO. In February 2024, they launched this service on Ethereum, enabling users to participate in staking on the Bittensor network and earn returns over 16%.

**Here’s how Tensorplex Stake works:**
1. Users can stake their wTAO (a token used on the Bittensor network) and receive stTAO in return. StTAO represents your staked TAO and tracks staking rewards.
   
2. These staked wTAO are bridged to the Bittensor network and staked with validators to generate rewards. These rewards are returned to users without requiring them to bridge assets to Bittensor.

This method allows Ethereum users to more easily participate in TAO earning opportunities without needing to move their assets to other networks.

The content simplified by GPT is noticeably more readable, proving that reducing cognitive load can indeed be an effective way to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, AI can be helpful in this process.
