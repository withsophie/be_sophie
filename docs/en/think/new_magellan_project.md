On the scale of the universe, there exists a labyrinth. This gigantic labyrinth, with a diameter of 17 billion light-years, holds the ultimate secrets of the universe on a planet with a mere radius of 100,000 kilometers. Humanity has no clues on how to find this planet.

Firstly, the biggest challenge is whether this planet and the ultimate truth it holds even exist. This premise might be purely fictional, yet there’s no way to prove or disprove it. Therefore, we can only name this hypothesis “faith.”

Next, assuming we continuously move in a specific direction, we will inevitably reach this “Star of Truth.” However, it might take several generations, or even the entire history of humanity, to reach it. Based on faith, the only feasible way is to establish this belief as humanity’s collective mission, allowing generation after generation to bridge the astronomical distance. This direction is rationalism; this steering wheel is the mission’s inheritance, and this spaceship is the collectivist system.

Secondly, we all know that this certain path doesn’t actually exist. How can humanity, without any information about the Star of Truth, expect its existence? As humans gazed into the universe, they first realized the unimaginable vastness of space, then the unimaginable continuation of time. As human cognition progressed, they conceived Plato’s Cave, only to discover that they were just a group of cave dwellers trapped in a four-dimensional space.

One day, humanity received a revelation from the Star of Truth, but they couldn’t understand its meaning at all. The symbols (grammar) used to express the revelation might not be isomorphic with any human language, let alone translatable. After prolonged and fruitless efforts, humanity realized that the thought patterns of the universal truth were entirely different from human brain structures. These thought patterns were like songs, poems, paintings, and riddles combined, ostensibly a cheat sheet from the beings on the Star of Truth favoring humanity, but ultimately an insurmountable gulf in symbols (language and thought patterns).

Finally, forced by survival, humans had no choice but to take the step off Earth. Before leaving their home planet, Earthlings reached only a few consensuses, probably the most rational agreements in human history:

1. Each spaceship decides how to explore, and the descendants of its members must build new ships to carry out their own exploration tasks independently.
2. Each spaceship is required to share their voyage logs and gained knowledge with all other ships; everything else is optional.
3. Ships must not interfere with each other. Each ship can decide to explore using its own theories and routes, or by adopting the theories and routes of other recognized ships. Success or failure will be determined by natural selection.
4. Each ship is equipped with an extremely simple yet incredibly powerful computer that only records the cumulative knowledge of all ships. It cannot help crew members discover new knowledge. Before the captain makes an exploratory decision, he must reference all historical human knowledge on the subject.

Although these are the simplest and perhaps the most foolish rules, they are likely the most reliable method for ensuring that among billions of ships over billions of years, one might eventually reach the Star of Truth.

Perhaps, when they finally reach the Star of Truth, a giant sculpture stands on the planet, depicting a chaotic, intertwined sphere of energy and information, inscribed with the following words:

> “Infinite time and space, extreme complexity, hidden dimensions, the singer’s melody, every species is insignificant before them.
> 
> Whoever reaches this star should know that the universal truth lies in the journey to this star.
> 
> That is—
> 
> Only evolution can contend with the infinite.”
